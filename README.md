# Word Guessing Game

This is a simple word guessing game written in Java using Swing for the GUI.

## How to Play

The game selects a random word from a list of pre-defined words, and displays the word as a series of dashes representing each letter in the word. The player can guess the word by typing in a single letter or a word of the same length as the hidden word.

For each incorrect guess, the number of remaining guesses is decreased. If the player correctly guesses all the letters in the word before running out of guesses, they win the game. Otherwise, they lose.

## How to Run

To run the game, simply run the `Main.java` file located in the `src` folder.
